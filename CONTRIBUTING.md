# Contribute with Git Branch

**Git Branching**

GIT Branching is the strategy or systematic procedure of creating the branch and follow that up for merging that with the main copy of the main branch of the codebase. Before getting into the GIT branch, Letâ€™s see why we need a branch.

### Permissions for Contributor

1. A **Contributor** can deploy code to `development` branch. For testing purposes. 
2. **Contributor** can't merge/push their code to `master` branch.
3. **Contributor** can create a pull request for project owner for review and merge. 
4. **Contributor**  can create any branch and merge to `development` and deploy code for review. 
5. Only **project owner** can merge code to `master` branch
